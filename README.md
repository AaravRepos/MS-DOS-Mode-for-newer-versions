# MS-DOS Mode for Windows 10 and 11.
This is MS-DOS Mode
It enables the BCPE (Bootscreen Command Prompt Exploit.) The latest release (Pre-release) contains 3 files. I may add another file called WinXEditor.zip, so you can add msdos mode to the menu when you click Win + X.

# How to get files
Click Code > Download ZIP.
OR the more known method. Check out the releases - https://github.com/AaravRepos/MS-DOS-Mode-for-newer-versions/releases/

## download-winxeditor.zip.cmd (Code > Download ZIP only)
